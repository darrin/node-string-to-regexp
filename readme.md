# Introduction

The bold and brave will use 'eval' to do the same thing this module does - creates a Regexp.

Because this module is all about creating a regex from an input string - which could come from a user the use of eval in this context makes me nervous. So then - this module is for the weak of heart - like me who would prefer to avoid the potential of someone hijacking my software by way of some clever javascript introduced where a regexp was expected.
